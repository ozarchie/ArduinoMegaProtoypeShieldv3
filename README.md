# ArduinoMegaProtoypeShieldv3
Arduino Mega protoype shield for loading HC05/WiFi modules
Welcome to the ArduinoMegaProtoypeShieldv3 wiki!

# Process
## Used proto_shield_MEGA-REV3 as the starting point
This is the reference schematic and layout from Arduino  
The target board is the arduino Mega2560v3 prototype shield usually supplied with a mini breadboard.  
It is similar to this item:

I have no relationship with www.robotistan.com  

## Used Eagle 770 to edit schematic and board

The schematic was derived from an actual board.    
The board layout was measured from an actual board.  
  
     
<b>There are many points at which errors can be introduced.  
This is NOT a production item and has not been tested.    
It is for experimentation and collaboration only.    
At some stage, it may be 'released' as a verified design.  </b>

## Used eagle2fritzing to create Fritzing part

The part was generated using the eagle2fritzing technique.
See   
https://github.com/fritzing/eagle2fritzing

The program was re-compiled on macOS Sierra and run from the command line.  
`./run.sh ~/Documents/workspace/fritzing-myparts/`

## Minor modification in Fritzing to create and export part
